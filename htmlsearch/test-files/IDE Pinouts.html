    The pinouts are as follows:  (_NAME means signal active low)

    GROUND  |  43  |  --  |
    RESERVED|  44  |  --  |  Reserved for future definition
    As you can see, apart from the power pins, all the signals are exactly the
same.  The ones that say 'not supported yet' should still be connected.
The 44pin connector isn't a normal .1" IDC header, it's more like .075".
Spacing of the pins is 2mm with a 1mm cable.
